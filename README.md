# Machine-Learning-Models
This project is reference for various Machine Learning models. 

I wrote these codes for the assignments in the 'Machine Learning Foundations and Techniques' course from National Taiwan University on Coursera, which is extremely popular in Asia.

# Here is the content of the models:

hw1: CyclePLA, RandomCyclePLA, PocketCyclePLA

hw2: PLA with noise

hw3: linear regression and logistic regression

hw4: regularized linear regression

hw5: realization of SVM by differents methods

hw6: SVR, KRR, linear aggregation and adaptive boosting techiniques

hw7: C&RT, Random Forest

hw8: CNN, k-means, k-NN


Attention: all the codes are written by Jupyter Notebook
